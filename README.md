Copy layout and Grid settings from one artboard and paste into multiples artboards - in the future we plan to implement grid libraries, which will allow you to store grid presets within the Sketch applicaton.

Simple.

Easy to remember.

## Installation
[![Install Grid Master with Sketchpacks](http://sketchpacks-com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/badges/sketchpacks-badge-install.png "Install Grid Master with Sketchpacks")](https://sketchpacks.com/exevil/sketch-grid-master/install)

Since grid or layout visibility toggling are the most common functions in design workflow I used regular `CTRL + G` & `CTRL + L` shortcuts for these plugin commands. To make it work as expected you should assign any different shortcut to Sketch's default Show Grid and Show Layout functions. Here're 4 easy steps how to do it:

1. [Download](https://github.com/exevil/sketch-grid-master/archive/master.zip) and install Sketch Grid Master as any usual plugin by click on it;
2. Open ï£¿ â†’ System Preferences â†’ Keyboard â†’ Shortcuts â†’ App Shortcuts and hit the + button;
3. Choose Sketch.app as Application, enter "Show Grid" as Menu Title and assign `CTRL+ALT+G` as Keyboard Shortcut;
4. Repeat step 3 with "Show Layout" as Menu Title and `CTRL+ALT+L` as Keyboard Shortcut.

Voila! Now you can use familiar shortcuts with new functionality.
